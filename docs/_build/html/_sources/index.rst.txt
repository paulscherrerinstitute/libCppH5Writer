This library is used for creating C++ based stream writer for H5 files. It focuses on the functionality and performance needed for high performance detectors integrations.

Key features: 
      * Get data from ZMQ stream (Array-1.0 protocol) - htypes specification
      * Write Nexus complaint H5 file (User specified) - nexus format
      * Specify additional zmq stream parameters to write to file.
      * Receive additional parameters to write to file via REST api.
      * Interaction with the writer over REST api (stop, kill, get_statistics).
TOMCAT pco writer:

      * Based on a configuration file, TOMCAT pco writer will receive a zmq stream that is sent from the pco camera and store it into a H5 file.
      * The writer runs on xbl-daq-32 and is controlled by the pco_rclient remotely on any console or machine within tomcat's gateway (x06sa-gw).

It is developed using `c++`_ on an open-source project (`github repository`_) and documented here using readthedocs.
